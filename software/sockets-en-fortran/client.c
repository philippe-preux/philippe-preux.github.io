/*
 * File client.c
 *
 * This C source file comes along the server.f90 Fortran source to
 * demonstrate a simple server/client communication through sockets.
 * This client could have been written in any language. It is straitforward 
 * to write such a client in e.g. Python.
 *
 * This codes open a socket on which it expects a server is waiting for it.
 * As provided, server and client should run on the ame computer 
 * (IP 127.0.0.1), and communicate through port 1024. This value is easy 
 * to change through the PORT macro definition below.
 * 
 * When the connection is established with the server, this client loops.
 * At each iteration, it reads a string sent by the server, 
 * and then sends a message to it. The content of this message is a number,
 * starting at 10, incrementing it until 19 at which points is sends a
 * "STOP" string to the server to stop the communication.
 * I think the code is very simple and anyone understanding what it is about
 * may tailor it to his/her needs.
 * I have the hope that this client code is pretty portable; as explained in
 * its source code, I don't have the same optimism about the server.
 * This code has been developed and tested on a 64 bits PC computer
 * running Ubuntu 18.04, compiled by gcc version 7.5.0.
 *
 * Code developed by Philippe Preux, Universit√© de Lille, France & Inria.
 * Put online on April 4th, 2020, on https://ph-preux.github.io/...
