<h1>yaStoSOO: StoSOO (and SOO)</h1>

<p>

This page provides access to our implementation of StoSOO (Stochastic Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization). StoSOO was introduced in this <a href="jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/valko13.pdf‎">Valko, Carpentier, Munos, ICML 2013 paper</a>.

<br/>

We named this version of StoSOO yaStoSOO which stands for "yet another StoSOO".

<br/>
<br/>

<font color="red"><b>StoSOO is a black-box global optimization algorithm</b></font>. StoSOO makes almost no assumption about the function being optimized (in particular, StoSOO does not assume differentiability).
<br/>
StoSOO optimizes a real function which is stochastic (each time a point is evaluated, a different value is returned). It may also be used to optimize deterministic functions under the guise of SOO, an algorithm studied in this <a href="http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~munos/papers/files/opti2_nips2011.pdf">NIPS 2011 paper by Rémi Munos</a>.

<br/>
<br/>

StoSOO and SOO hence fall into the "global optimizer" category.

<br/>

Originally, these algorithms were designed as an application of bandit theory to function optimization. Hence, the algorithm may be seen as very pure; as function optimizers, they obviously lack many features that should be introduced to improve their performance. Anyway, StoSOO and SOO have very appealing theoretical properties regarding their expected performance after a certain amount of function evaluations; as far as we know, they are the only global otpimization algorithms for which such properties have been prooved.

<br/>

StoSOO and SOO work by partitioning, in the same spirit as Jones's DiRect.

<font color="red"><b>Download:</b></font> The most recent release is v.0.3. It is available by <a href="./yaStoSOO.v.0.3.tgz" onclick="stosooLinkClicked()">clicking on this link</a>. I'd appreciate that you send me an email when you download the software (philippe -dot- preux -at- univ-lille3 -dot- fr); that way, I'll be able to inform you of any future release. I'd also be very happy to hear about your use of this software.

<br/>
<br/>

This implementation is in C, and has been developed under Linux/Ubuntu. Its installation on any Linux system, and Mac OS, is probably very easy and straitforward. I do not see any reason why this code would'nt run on other platform, but I do not intend to care about it.

<br/>
<br/>

<font color="red"><b>Manual:</b></font> There is a manual about the installation and how to use this code. It is available by <a href="./stosoo.v.0.3/manual.yaStoSOO.v.0.3.pdf">clicking on this link</a>.

<ul>
  <li>on a set of functions published in the proceedings of CEC 2014. <a href="https://philippe.preux.github.io/publis.html#cec2014">The paper is available here</a>. We participated to <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/EPNSugan/index_files/CEC2014/CEC2014.htm">the Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization</a>, ranking 10th and 11th (out of 17 participants) with two versions of SOO.</li>
  <li>with the <a href="http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php">BBOB library</a> in the proceedings of CEC 2015.</li>
</ul>

<font color="red"><b>History of versions:</b></font>

<br/>

Please note that this software has been extensively debugged while optimizing deterministic functions (hence, in SOO mode). We will currently paying strong attention to noisy optimization to assess StoSOO.
