    <h1>Motivations</h1>

    <p>

      My motivation for doing my job, and before that, being a student and aiming at becoming a researcher, is mostly a search for <i>understanding</i> things, and <i>think</i> about things. And sharing this with other people, colleagues, students, whoever might be interested in, together going further towards new unknown territories.

    </p>

    <p>
      
      I am not really interested in digging further, rather in finding new areas to dig into. I prefer exploring new areas, rather than exploiting.

      <br/>
      
      This led me to change my field of interest very strongy along the years and visit various remote areas of computer science: symbolic AI, computer architecture, languages and compilers, genetic algorithms, combinatorial optimization, multi-agent systems, machine learning, data mining, numerical/statistical AI.

      <br/>
      
      This also led me to work with researchers of other fields: marine biologists, behaviorist psychologists, agronomists, health researchers.

      <br/>
      
      This also led me to collaborate with companies on various topics to understand companies point of view, needs, <i>etc</i>.

    <h1>Research activities and projects</h1>

    <p>
      
      In this section, I describe my current research activities and projects.

      <br/>

      Fundamentally, my research domain is machine learning, and particularly sequential decision making under unceertainty, mostly reinforcement learning, a bit of bandits, and a bit of any other relevant topic.
      
      <br/>

      I have decided a couple of years ago to focus on a set of research topics and applications of my research. After 30 years of research activities, I feel like I need to try to make my research useful, at least to some extent, to the well-being of society, humankind, and Life on earth (!). This led me to select the set of research questions I want to investigate in the coming years. Regarding applications, I want to focus on health, and sustainable development.

      <br/>

      I think that machine learning has brought new tools, algorithms, methods, ... that have to be used, put to the test, and tailored to important fields of applications. Applications also bring questions and challenges that have to be dealt with by fundamental research, and drawing my attention to issues that are meaningfull.

      <br/>

      My main field of research is reinforcement learning and, more generally, sequential decision making under uncertainty. The biggest achievement to date of RL is learning to play go, better than any human being: this is indeed an achievement, but this is still very modest when I compare the complexity of go to the complexity of applications I mention above, and applications that people are interested in be it in companies or in other institutions (hospital, ...). To be able to tackle such complex applications, pure RL is far from being enough. We need to combine, or hybrid, RL with all possible techniques and knowledge that can be useful to solve such problems. Hence, today, beyond trying to make RL better, my main research line is how can we do this? Very often, a learning algorithm re-discovers things human beings know perfectly well: obviously, the learning algorithm would benefit from this knowledge in the first place. An other thing is that when one looks at how an RL algorithm is learning to solve a task, one identifies ways in which it could do better if it was able to use even basic rules; based on statistics and correlation, RL algorithm induce regularities but they can not induce logic rules, they can not even use logic rules: they gather thousands, millions, sometimes billions of data but they can not induce even the simplest rule out of them. Once being able to use rules, the RL would be able to reason, anipulate knowledge to deduce new facts: again, such simple things are not done by today RL algorithms.

    <h2>Research: general topics</h2>    

    <p>

      In this section, I say a few words about the directions in which I already work or I want to work in the coming years.
      
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>generalization in RL.
	<br/>
	An RL agent having been trained to solve one, or a couple, of tasks, how can it solve other, related, tasks? This question encompasses transfer learning, but goes far beyond.</li>
      <li>non stationary combinatorial optimization problems with uncertainty.
	<br/>
      </li>
      <li>combining numerical learning and symbolic learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      To sum-up my thinking about so-called AI, there is absolutely nothing intelligent in it: current AI systems, sometimes achieving remarkable feats, are completely stupid, and rely exclusively on computation power, and the smartness of their designers and implementors. I want to go further than that. There are numerous tasks where current state-of-the-art AI is simply unable to do anyhting or, if it can, does it in a completely stupid way, a completely different way from the one we, as human beings, use. You may check <a href="private-investigations/IA.Grosse-blague.html">this page where I try to gather my thinking about AI</a> (sorry this page is written in French for the moment).

    <h1>Past activities</h1>

    <p>

      In this section, I very briefly describe the topics I worked on in the past.
      
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>in symbolic AI: mostly in the 1980's, at the glorious time of expert systems, I was very interested in AI languages (mostly Lisp and Smalltalk and a bit of Prolog) for knowledge representation and reasoning.</li>
      <li>computer architecture (1990-1992): part of my PhD thesis is dedicated to proposing to execute vector operations in an out-of-order way, in order to reduce contentions due to dependencies. This idea was later developed further in T. Kechadi's PhD</li>
      <li>Languages and compilers (1988-1992): during my PhD and a bit afterwards, we designed various languages and language constructs to express vector operations instead of the traditionnal loop expression. I was mostly concerned by the low level part: I designed a vector virtual machine and its vector intermediate language, and I implemented an interpreter of this language on Sun workstation, and Cray Y-MP.</li>
      <li>genetic algorithm (1993-1999): I studied he dynamics of the population of a genetic algorithm. I read a lot about the theory of natural selection in biology, and I was able to observe many aspects of the dynamics of population in genetic algorithms. </li>
      <li>combinatorial optimization (1995-1999): I studied the notion of optimization landscape of a couple of combinatorial optimization problems, in particular the TSP. I had in mind to use simple hill-climbing algorithms to study the topology of this landscape, better understand the behavior of such search algorithms, trying to understand what makes an instance easy or hard to solve.</li>
      <li>multi-agent systems (1997-1999): collaborating with marine biologists, we design a MAS to investigate the hypothesis that the copepod is actively looking for food, not just waiting for food to flow in its mouth.</li>
      <li>reinforcement learning (1994-2004): I spent many years collaborating with psychologists to understand how animal behavior is acquired, how animals adapt to their environment, ... This eventually led me to reinforcement learning.</li>
      <li>graphs: as a computer scientist, I see graphs everywhere. I have investigated Markov decision problems considered as graphs, evolving graphs, graph representation, graph generation, combinatorial optimization problems related to graphs, and many other aspects of graphs.</li>
      <li>machine learning for software development (2010-2018): through a couple of collaborations, I have investigated how machine learning can be used to help software development. Graphs are involved either as the control graph of a sofwtare, or as an artefact hierarchy, or other graphs that are natural representations of software artefacts. </li>
      <li>reinforcement learning (since 2000): I have also studied RL as a computer scientist, investigating algorithms to solve this problem, applying them to solve real/realistic problems, ...</li>
      <li>machine learning (since 2000): I have studied various aspects of machine learning. LARS and sparse function approximators (to be used in RL); sparse matrix factorization; data which attributes are functions; random matrix theory.</li>
      <li>bandits (2009-2017): recommendation systems; computational advertising; real function optimization</li>
    </ul>
